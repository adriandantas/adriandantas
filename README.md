I am a passionate IT professional with a focus on cloud computing and DevOps, constantly seeking new challenges that allow me to expand my skills and knowledge. My professional focus is to deliver value designing and delivering DevOps solutions with Kubernetes. My go-to tools include Terraform and Ansible, which I use for deployment automation.

In my free time, I enjoy playing the piano and going on road trips on my motorcycle to explore new places and enjoy the freedom of the open road.
